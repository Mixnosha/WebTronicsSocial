#### 🙆🏾 My test task I hope you like it



### 👷‍♂️Implemented on the project
- Functional requirements:
    - :white_check_mark: There should be some form of authentication and registration (JWT, Oauth, Oauth 2.0, etc..)
    - :white_check_mark: As a user I need to be able to signup and login
    - :white_check_mark: As a user I need to be able to create, edit, delete and view posts
    - :white_check_mark: As a user I can like or dislike other users’ posts but not my own 
    - :white_check_mark: The API needs a UI Documentation (Swagger/ReDoc)
- Bonus section (not required):
    - :x: Use https://clearbit.com/platform/enrichment for getting additional data for the user on signup
    - :white_check_mark: Use emailhunter.co for verifying email existence on registration
    - :white_check_mark: Use an in-memory DB for storing post likes and dislikes (As a cache, that gets updated whenever new likes and dislikes get added)
